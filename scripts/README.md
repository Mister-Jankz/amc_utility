# Scripts

This folder contains added scripts, added by anyone, which can help you making CER more effective.

Each script will have a specific function, so adding a new script would require you to describe in the script what it does, or provide a link to more information on the script.

## coalesce-asciidoc

Will coalesce the CER you've made into one file, effectively removing the chapter structure. It may be useful in some situations where Asciidoctor is not doing what you expect it to do.
